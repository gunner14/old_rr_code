This file should place in the following path
/trunk/training/ObjectCacheDemoShell

The executable file will search for lib files in the following paths
$ICE_HOME/lib64
/usr/local/xce/lib64/

# cd build
Compile the source files

# ./make.sh
This will generate a client and a server

Run the server
./server : create objects with default capacity (1000000) 
./server size : create objects with giving capacity
# ./server

Run the client in another console with parameter as follow
./client -load : load 1000000 objects
./client -preload : preload 1000000 objects
./client -reload : reload 1000000 objects
./client -get : get sample email of objects
./client -get id : get email by id, id should be an integer
./client -set id email : set email of id, id should be an integer
./client -touch : touch sample email of objects
./client -touch id : touch email of id, id should be an integer

When use preload or reload method, the task will be execute by taskmanager,
so it will return before the task is finished.

preload won't create object that already exist, while reload will.

get will load missing object, and affect LRU queue, while touch won't
