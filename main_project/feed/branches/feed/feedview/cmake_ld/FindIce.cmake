# Locate Ice home

# This module defines the following variables:
# ICE_FOUND : 1 if Ice is found, 0 otherwise
# ICE_HOME  : path where to find include, lib, bin, etc.
#
#
# ICEJ_FOUND : 1 if Ice for Java is found, 0 otherwise
# ICEJ_HOME  : path where to find Ice for Java archive

#
# Ice for C++
#

# Assumption: we look for Ice.h and assume that the rest is there.
# i.e. slice2cpp, libIce.so, etc.
# to be more robust we can look for all of those things individually.

# start with 'not found'
